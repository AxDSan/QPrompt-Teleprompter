# Pun Facts
Teleprompters are sometimes called "autocues" and a TV director should always cue the prompter operator. That's why QPrompt is short for Cue Prompter. Also, QPrompt is built using the Qt framework. The Q is meant to reference that and also mean Quick, because teleprompter operators need to be fast in their work.
