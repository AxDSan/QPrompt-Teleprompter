# Pun Facts
QPrompt is short for Cue Prompter, something said to cue teleprompter operators. Teleprompters are sometimes referred to as "autocue". Also, QPrompt is built using the Qt framework. The Q is meant to reference all of these things and also the word "quick", because teleprompter operators must be quick to respond to what happens on set.
