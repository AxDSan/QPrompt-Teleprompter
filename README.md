# Pun Facts
QPrompt is short for Cue Prompter, something TV directors say to cue teleprompter operators. Teleprompters are sometimes referred to as "autocue". Also, QPrompt is built using the Qt framework. The Q is meant to reference all of these things and also the word "quick", because teleprompter operators must be quick to respond to what happens on set.
