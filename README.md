# Pun Facts
QPrompt is short for Cue Prompter, something said to cue teleprompter operators. Teleprompters are sometimes referred to as "autocue". Also, QPrompt is built using the Qt framework. The Q is meant to reference all of these things and also the word "quick", because teleprompter operators must be quick to respond to what happens on set.

QPrompt, this app, is not related in any way to Q-Prompt Inc. nor is it to be confused with Qprompt, the Python library, or CuePrompter, the teleprompter software.
