<p>Thank you for using QPrompt!</p>

<p><a href="#">QPrompt</a> takes the stress away from teleprompter operation, so you can enjoy media production better and avoid dealing with memorization.</p>

<p>Our goal with QPrompt is to make it easy to operate a teleprompter, while maximizing performance, feature availability, and control accuracy.</p>
<p>QPrompt is free software as defined by the FSF, meaning you're free to share, study, and modify the software to your needs.</p>
<p>Visit the website <a href="https://qprompt.app/">qprompt.app</a> for instructional materials and to download the latest version of QPrompt. You can also contribute to QPrompt's development yourself by helping translate the program and its resources at<br><a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">l10n.qprompt.app</a>,<br>or by giving feedback or reporting issues at<br><a href="https://feedback.qprompt.app/">feedback.qprompt.app</a></p>

<p>QPrompt is pronounced "Q" "Prompt". The name is short for Cue Prompter, something directors say to cue teleprompter operators.<br>Also, QPrompt is built using the Qt framework. The Q is meant to reference all of these things plus the word "quick", because teleprompter operators must be quick to respond to what happens on set.</p>
